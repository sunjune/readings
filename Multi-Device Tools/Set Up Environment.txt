Truly learn to use your editor
深入学习使用你的编辑器

Code editors are the quintessential development tool. But what makes an editor more than a simple word processor are its shortcuts that get you working faster.
代码编辑器是开发工具的精髓。但是让编辑器有别于简单字处理器的是它的快捷方式给你工作带来的便利。

You know you’ve truly learned to use your editor when you are able to quickly move around your code using a range of keyboard short-cuts and editor commands. It’s always good to keep a cheatsheet handy for editor commands. Top editors also let you customize commands and keyboard shortcuts so that you only have to remember your own implementations.
你知道在你深入学习了编辑器的使用之后你就能用一系列键盘快捷方式和编辑命令在你的代码中快速游移。对编辑器命令做个备忘单总是能派上用场的。最好的编辑器能让你定制命令和键盘快捷方式而你只要记住自己的执行方式即可。

Sublime is a great editor with tons of plugins to help you write better code faster. It also has a package manager that makes it easy to install new plugins. Though Sublime costs money, you can try it for free and this guide assumes Sublime as the default editor of choice.
Sublime(http://www.sublimetext.com/)是一款非常棒的编辑器，有无数的插件可以帮你把代码写得更好更快。它也有扩展包管理器非常容易安装新插件。虽然Sublime是收费的，但你可以试用它的免费版，本教程假设Sublime是你的默认编辑器选择。

Note
切记

Rob Dodson's blog post on how to get to know and love Sublime is a great reference for getting the most out of your editor. The concepts are relevant to any text editor, not just Sublime.
Rob Dodson关于如何了解并爱上Sublime的博客文章(http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/06/23/sublime-text-2-tips-and-shortcuts/)是一篇如何有效利用你的编辑器的非常棒的参考。这些概念适用于任何文本编辑器，不仅是Sublime。

Install the package manager
安装扩展包管理器

Package managers make it easy to find, install, and keep packages / plugins up-to-date.
扩展包管理器将查找、安装以及保持扩展包/插件更新变得很容易。

Here’s a sneak peak at what you can do with the Sublime Text package manager.

There’s a plugin for that
有插件是干那个的

Plugins help you stay more productive. What are the things you keep having to go back out to other tools to do?
Linting - there’s a plugin for that. Showing what changes haven’t been committed - there are plugins for that. Integration with other tools, such as GitHub, there are plugins for that.


Package managers make it very easy to find, install, and update plugins. In the Sublime editor, open your package manager (ctrl+shift+p), enter ‘Install Package’, and then enter the name of the plugin you are looking for (or else browse all plugins).
